## Reporting a Security Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security vulnerability in Omni-IDE, please do not open a public issue. Instead, report it privately to ensure the safety of all users.

You can contact the lead developer directly:
- **Email**: hi@nihu.in

We take all security reports seriously and will work to resolve identified issues as quickly as possible. Thank you for helping keep Omni-IDE secure!
